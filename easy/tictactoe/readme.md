# project: Tic-Tac-Toe

## About

Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Let's program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!

## Learning outcomes

After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using methods, handling errors, and processing user input

## What you'll do and what you'll learn

[Stage 1/5: Welcome to the battlefield!](https://hyperskill.org/projects/48/stages/255/implement)

To start things off, the program needs to be able to print any state of the field. You'll write a serious multi-line program using a lot of prints.


[Stage 2/5: The user is the gamemaster](https://hyperskill.org/projects/48/stages/256/implement)


Now it's time to analyze user input and print the state of the field depending on it. You'll learn to address specific positions in a string to achieve the required outcome.


[Stage 3/5: What's up on the field?](https://hyperskill.org/projects/48/stages/257/implement)

Now we're going to write a fully-functioning multi-line program that responds to the user's actions and analyzes the state of the field. Not only will it tell you who is winning, but it will also determine if the situation on a given field is theoretically possible!


[Stage 4/5: First move!](https://hyperskill.org/projects/48/stages/258/implement)

Tic-tac-toe is not all about analysis -- a game is meant to be played! Write a program that can change the state of the field, as your first real step toward a fully-functioning game application!

Finally! Thanks to this app, you can always challenge a friend to play a quick game of Tic-Tac-Toe!
